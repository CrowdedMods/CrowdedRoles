# CrowdedRoles
CrowdedRoles (CR) is our biggest project yet. It is Among Us API allowing you to create custom roles, buttons and stuff much easier\
This is not an independent mod! Install this only if you know what you're doing

## Documentation
Coming soon, use XML docs in source code for now

## Using in your project
Reference installed CrowdedRoles dll in your `.csproj` via Deobfuscate task. It should look like this `<Deobfuscate Include="$(AmongUs)\BepInEx\plugins\CrowdedRoles-$(GameVersion).dll" />`

# Buidling
Debug build (as for now) has a lot of testing stuff located in `TestRole.cs` so if you don't want to see it, you should build CR library with Release configuration

## Contributing
This project was private for 3 months but we're still in beta so feel free to reference any issue/suggestion or even PR your changes
